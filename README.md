**[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

Here are my experiments playing with programming just for fun.

My values for this experiment:
- *Have Fun and Learn along the Way* over compete
- *Use Simple Coding Rules* over crazy optimizations that end up making your code unreadable by humans
